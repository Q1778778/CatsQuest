The following is the structure of player.json:

location: (*initial location of the player*)
  row: int
  col: int

level: int (*initial level of the player*)

strength: int (*initial strength of player*)

health: int (*initial health of player*)

experience: int (*experience value of player*)

keys: string list (*keyboard buttons that control the players' movements,
e.g. ["left", "right", "up", "down"]*)

In order to advance to the next level, a player needs an experience of 
(player's current level) * 100 or above for a single level. 
The maximum strength and health of a player is 100.
